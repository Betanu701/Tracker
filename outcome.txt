 Do you complete all your three milestones? 
	I did not complete all three milestones. I built a basic website and was able to get a login and user authentication. I was not abel to get a tv traacker working.

 What had already been done?
	Part of the authentication was already done. I modified it and added an entire frontend to it. I also built a Mysql database to use/

 What need to be done to improve the app?
	Actually getting a tracker and tv show search. There are alot of bugs that is in the program. Alot of security flaws in using mysql.

 What kind of problems do you have during the development? (If you've solved the problems, please list your solution.)

I was able to get my site up and running on my local machine. It would not run on the heroku server however. I am thinking it has something to do with linux being captital specific. I tried reading the error codes but it kept saying it is something with my program. It was something to do with npm and my program. Also trying to build a database with tv directories seemed to be an extremly difficult task.
